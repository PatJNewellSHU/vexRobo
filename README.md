# VEX EXP Robot – Object Retrieval Automation
This project is a VEX EXP robot program designed to detect, retrieve, and return objects. It's ideal for scenarios such as table-top cleaning or assisting users with limited mobility.

## Features
The robot is programmed to:
- Search for an object on a table.
- Move towards the detected object.
- Pick up the object using its onboard mechanism.
- Return the object to its original starting position.
- If the object is off the table, the robot will spin and continue searching until a valid object is found.

⚠️ Please note: While the robot performs all tasks as demonstrated in the project video, some attempts may require retries due to hardware or sensor variability.
